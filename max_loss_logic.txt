example:

500 / 6000 = quantity_purchased
quantity_purchased * 5000 = balance
500 - balance = loss

500 / current_price = quantity_purchased
quantity_purchased * lowest_price = 400 (dollar_investment - max_loss)
lowest_price = 400 / quantity_purchased

- need to display total gain/loss in GUI
- refresh every couple seconds or minute?
- kill program every night at midnight for now?

pseudo:

total_loss = None
total_gain = None
max_loss = <user_input>
lowest_balance_allowed = dollar_investment - max_loss
lowest_price_allowed = lowest_balance_allowed / quantity_purchased

dollar_investment / current_price() = quantity_purchased
quantity_purchased * current_price() = new_dollar_balance



if dollar_investment > new_dollar_balance
	# loss
	loss = dollar_investment - new_dollar_balance
	total_loss += loss

	if total_gain - loss >= 0
		total_gain -= loss
	else
		total_gain = 0

	if total_loss >= max_loss
		sys.exit()


if dollar_investment < new_dollar_balance
	#gain
	gain = new_dollar_balance - dollar_investment
	total_gain += gain

	if total_loss - gain >= 0
		total_loss -= gain
	else
		total_loss = 0
